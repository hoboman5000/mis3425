						<h2>Orlando Resorts</h2>
							<p>This trip was part work and part pleasure. I had the opportunity to travel to the Lead365 leadership conference for my role with student government. Out of my own pocket I 
								spent some extra time in Florida before and after the conference at Universal Studios Orlando and Disney World. I had always wanted to go, and managed to this trip where 
								I was joined by part of my family. We had the fun of experiencing then end of Halloween at Universal and the start of Christmas at Disney.

						<h3>Universal Studios</h3>
						<img src="./images/florida/hogwarts_thumb.jpg">
							<p>I was on the fence about Universal Studios Orlando. The price of this park had me questioning if it was worth it, as well as horror stories about the long lines at the park. I was pleasantly surprised. 
							We only went to the Studios and Islands of Adventure sections, choosing not to attend the Volcano Bay water park due to a lack of time. Thanks to attending on a low visitation day, and being a bit selective in our rides, 
							we managed to ride everything we wanted to with the aide of a Fast-Pass and the short lines. As adult travelers I really enjoyed Universal more than I did Disney, and want to go back to ride what we missed, and several of 
							the others again. We just missed the old Harry Potter coaster before it was removed to make was for the new addition. I'm planning to return to the park when I decide to go to Disney again for Star Wars Land. I will spend 
							most of my time at Universal though.
							<br>
							We made a small mistake here and decided to cram this visit in the same day after flying in on a red-eye flight. We didn't realize the park would close at 6 pm, and were trying to rush everywhere while exhausted. Lesson learned.

						<h3>Disney World</h3>
						<img src="./images/florida/cinderellascastle_thumb.jpg">
							<p>This visit was mostly to fulfill a childhood dream and to see how it was different from the way I remembered Disneyland. I had many issues with this resort. First, the Fast-Pass system is confusing, limited to 2 rides per day, and 
							you can only use it in one park per day. It completely negates the ability to move from park to park. The park hoping feature is a waste. The time it takes to go from park to park for us took 2 hours at times to get from one park, through 
							security, and finally able to enjoy the park. In all honesty, if planning to attend Disney World, and wanting to see it all, budget for 4-5 days depending on your family and desires. Use their reservation system for food if you plan to eat in the 
							park. The sit-down dining options virtually require it. For a young family or a Disney fanatic I can see the appeal, but for myself I only plan to go back to Disney for the new Star Wars Land and the see what I missed at Animal Kingdom due to not 
							being able to use the Fast-Pass at multiple parks.</p>	
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:4">
						<h3>Am I Going Back?</h3>
							<p>I want to go back to Universal Studios to hit some of the rides again, and those that I missed. If I combine it with a visit to the water park, I can justify it to myself with the high cost of admission.
							<br>
							Disney is harder to justify. I wanted to ride the Pandora ride at Animal Kingdom, but the restrictions on the Fast-Pass made it impossible to justify with the 3 hour wait the day I was there. If I go back, I would 
							plan to spend most my time at Universal with a day for Animal Kingdom and a day at Disney's Hollywood Studios for the new Star Wars Land.
