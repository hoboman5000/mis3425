						<h2>My First Caribbean Cruise</h2>
							<p class="tripIntro">This was my first trip to the Caribbean, my first trip out of the US since 2006, and the first time I had been on the East Coast since 1997. Naturally there was a bit of stress with the trip, but it had a lot of learning opportunities.</p>

						<h3>St Marteen/St Martin</h3>
						<img src="./images/caribbean2015/stmartin_mahobeach_thumb.jpg" alt="A jet landing over Maho Beach on St Martin">
						<p>Our first stop was the split island of St Marteen/St Martin. Half Dutch and half French the island was full of amazing people. For this stop we had looked at a beach tour from the cruise provider, but I was able to find 
						a better deal on Viator and booked a full day tour of the island. Our guide was very knowledgeable, friendly, and explained the history and culture of the island throughout our tour.</p>
						
						<h4>Tips on St Marteen/St Martin:</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>French side beaches are clothing optional, be prepared!</li>
						<li>There are many high-end residences and resorts, allowing lots of options to go and stay rather than just visit on a cruise</li>
						<li>The beaches are beautiful, plan some time for enjoying them</li>
						<li>Have a rain poncho handy, we didn&apos;t and were caught in a sudden storm</li>
						<li>If you want history (museums, historic sites, etc.) there are some available, but not much that we found like other destinations</li>
						</ul>
						
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:4">
						<h3>Puerto Rico</h3>
						<img src="./images/caribbean2015/prforts_thumb.jpg" alt="View of the Atlantic from one of the Spanish Forts in San Juan, Puerto Rico">
						<p>We visited the old city section of San Juan, Puerto Rico for this visit. Old San Juan hosts the original Spanish settlement of the island, the massive colonial fortifications, and the tourist area. Streets are narrow, cobblestoned, and steep in places.
						Also in this area is the territorial capitol of Puerto Rico, don&apos;t forget that Puerto Rico is a US Territory. I am a history nerd, particularly for Colonial and Early Modern history. On this visit to San Juan I chose a walking tour of the old city that took 
						us to the main colonial fort, through the city to the territorial capitol, and to a communal hall showcasing the architectural style of the culture. Getting to see these sites in person, especially the UNESCO World Heritage site of Castillo de San Crist&oacute;bal, 
						was an awesome experience.</p>
						<h4>Tips for San Juan, Puerto Rico</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>Be in shape for walking tours, this area is steep, uneven, etc, by the end many of our group were about to fall over</li>
						<li>We didn&apos;t learn our lesson on St Martin, bring a disposable poncho. Sudden storms are a real threat.</li>
						<li>Hydrate! Bring water, buy water, do something. Coming from a low humidity climate I didn&apos;t realize how fast I would lose water in a high temp, high humidity climate while walking.</li>
						<li>Plan time to see both Castillo San Felipe del Morro and Castillo de San Crist&oacute;bal, I missed del Morro and regret it.</li>
						<li>Traffic is bad in this area, be prepared to walk. The streets are narrow, steep, and cobblestoned.</li>
						<li>This experience taught me the value of a good pair of walking shoes, even when cruising.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Grand Turk</h3>
						<img src="./images/caribbean2015/grand_turk_thumb.jpg" alt="Margarita-ville on Grand Turk">
						<p>
						This was my fun stop on the cruise. We booked a power snorkel tour and it didn&apos;t disappoint. The island itself is flat, and was rebuilding after a hurricane. The beaches and reefs though were great. The power snorkel made 
						a huge difference in the experience, one I wouldn&apos;t appreciate until a later trip. I really do recommend them if you are doing a long snorkel trip. Many people chose to take advantage of the Jimmy Buffet Margarita-ville beach club just off the cruise terminal, 
						but I found that there are many options around the small island. This club is the one pictured in the banner, and was one of the few areas with trees. Personally, I wouldn&apos;t chose this as a destination for a long vacation, but as a stop on a cruise it was a great day spot. 
						Of interest for the history geek was the Project Mercury connection of the island. Located just off the cruise dock is a small installation highlighting the role the region played during the Space Race. Friendship 7, the Mercury mission piloted by John Glenn landed near by and was 
						brought to the island before returning to the US. As a space nerd since childhood, I had some fun here getting to see the history and how the locals still took pride in it.</p>
						<h4>Tips for Grand Turk</h4>
						<ul>
						<li>Bring water, it&apos;s a small island and stores seemed sparse in some areas.</li>
						<li>Sunscreen! Playing in water you&apos;ll need to reapply frequently.</li>
						<li>When I was there there was a lack of shade, many trees had been destroyed by the recent hurricane.</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:6">
						<h3>Florida Everglades</h3>
						<img src="./images/caribbean2015/everglades_thumb.jpg" alt="Airboats in the Everglades">
						<p>To wrap up this trip, and since we had a later flight home, we did the tourist thing and booked an air-boat tour of the Everglades. Another interest of mine is water gardening, and seeing some of the natural ecosystems at work was fun for me.
						 It was obviously a tourist trap, but still fun. Even the gator and reptile zoo that allowed seeing these massive reptiles and their relatives up close and personal.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:7">
						<h3>Am I Going Back?</h3>
						<p class="tripIntro">I would go back to San Juan or St Marteen/St Martin as a stand alone vacation. The Everglades are more of a stop on another trip, and only if I had time or for another reason such as to see Lake Okeechobee.
						Personally, Grand Turk was beautiful, but I would only go back if visiting as part of a tour of the Turks and Caicos Islands or on another cruise.</p>
