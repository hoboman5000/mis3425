						<h2>My First Cruise and First Time Leaving the US</h2>
						<p class="tripIntro">My first experience with international travel was a cruise with my cousin to Mexico. We wanted to get away from work and a tough winter, he wanted to do a cruise, and I was ready to go. 
						I really wish I had paid more attention on this trip, but I decided to have a bit of a party instead.</p>

					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:3">
						<h3>Cabo San Lucas</h3>
							<p>Cabo was beautiful, with amazing people when I was there in 2006. This was just as the building boom was beginning in this resort destination and it hadn&apos;t quite gotten become the tourist town it is now.
							The waterfront had just been renovated, however, the proposed cruise pier hadn&apos;t been built. Many of the hotels that now line the beaches to the west were not there yet. I really enjoyed the kayak trip to 
							Lover&apos;s Beach. The guide pointed out the deep underwater canyon we were traveling over at the time, and the strong currents on the Pacific side of the beach. Snorkeling in the Sea of Cortez was beautiful,
							and someday I plan to return to scuba dive there. I would love to witness the annual underwater sandfall events that occur on the canyon walls.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:4">
						<h3>Mazatlan</h3>
							<p><em>Pay for a taxi!</em> That&apos;s my advice for visiting the tourist section of Mazatlan, especially if you arrived by cruise ship. The cruise terminal is on the opposite side of the city from the main tourist zone. 
							The city is very poor, but the tourist section was well kept and secure when I was there. Of note, personal safety is in your own hands. It was very windy the day we were there and we wanted to para-sail. 
							On one side of the peninsula no one would do it due to the wind, a local said he knew a group that would. He hiked us around the peninsula, hence my advice on getting a taxi, trying to sell us drugs the whole way. 
							After a few near death experiences with the wind and the para-sail, I had a great time. In the future, I know that para-sailing in near 50 mph winds is not the best idea.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:5">
						<h3>Puerto Vallarta</h3>
							<p>For this portion of the trip we did a short hike through a local canyon were we learned about the issues caused by the filming of the movie &quot;Predator.&quot; The story went that the producers didn&apos;t think
							the jungle looked enough like a jungle for their movie. They sprayed European Moss over the set area to enhance the feel, expecting it would not survive. Instead it had become invasive in the area, covering many trees.
							We also visited a small batch tequila distillery and learned how the drink is made, its history, and about the treaties regarding it and whiskey production between Mexico and the US.
							<br>
							The area was beautiful, especially at night, but we did have some issues with crime in the tourist area.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:6">
						<h3>Am I Going Back?</h3>
							<p>While it has been a while since I was in Mexico, I want to go back at some point. I would love to visit Cabo again, but am planning to visit Cozumel before returning to Cabo.</p>

						<h3>Memories from this trip</h3>
						<p class="tripIntro">Unfortunately, my pictures from this trip were done on a pair of film cameras. The photos and the negatives were damaged during a flood several years ago, and the scans I had on a hard drive were
						lost a few years after. I have yet to find my CD backups thanks to several moves and the rapid boxing to save what I could from the flood event.</p>
