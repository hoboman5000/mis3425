						<h2>Western Europe, Trans-Atlantic Cruise, and New York City</h2>
							<p>This is the longest trip I&apos;ve ever been on, the farthest from home I managed to travel, and my first time crossing the Prime Meridian. It taught me that 
							I hadn&apos;t learned the lessons I had thought I had. I also learned that I really do like the experience the cultures of the regions I travel to, while still 
							having a bit of fun on the way. It combined a cruise with some pre and post cruise self-guided touring.</p>

						<h3>London</h3>
						<img src="./images/europe2018/whitetower_thumb.jpg">
							<p>As I was booking this trip I realized that for the cost of a few nights hotel I could add a stop in Europe. Originally, we had planned to stay 2-3 days in Barcelona. However, when 
							I realized that London was in our budget I couldn&apos;t pass up the opportunity. Using Hotels.com we found an affordable hotel in Westminster near Hyde Park and Paddington Station. This provided 
							easy access to the Tube, or so I thought. What I didn't account for was that our trip occurred over a "Bank Holiday" similar to our Federal Holidays in the US. Because of this, the local authorities 
							had decided to take the lines we needed down for construction for half our stay. This ate into the planned savings by using the Tube to get around, by requiring 3 taxi trips that I hadn't budgeted for.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="lesson"><em>Lesson 1 - Plan extra money for unexpected mass-transit maintenance.</em></span>
							<br>
							<br>
							We managed to see most of what we wanted to over the 3 days in London. We made it to The Tower of London, Tower Bridge, Parliament (only the outside and it was under renovation), the British Museum, and a 
							day trip out to Bath to see the Roman Baths, and to Stonehenge. I had to compromise and miss a few things I wanted to and plan to go back when I make my trip to Scotland.
							<br>
							We did have it pointed out that we had very unusual weather during our stay. The whole time, not one drop of rain. I had planned for rain, and this was part of my over-packing.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="lesson"><em>Lesson 2 - Most of the time you can buy certain things on the cheap, like an umbrella, when you get there.</em></span>
							<h4>Tips for London</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>Research and understand the Tube. Apps like Movit are invaluable.</li>
							<li>Don't trust the "London in one day" website itineraries. We tried and they required not spending any time at the locations, and running from spot-to-spot.</li>
							<li>Food is everywhere, take time to enjoy it. London is a multi-ethnic city and almost anything is available if you look for it.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>

						<h3>Malaga, Granada, and the Alhambra</h3>
						<img src="./images/europe2018/alhambra1_thumb.jpg">
							<p>This was a place that Viator helped save me some money, and allowed me to do something I didn't think I otherwise would have been able to. The Carnival led excursion to the Alhambra palace complex had been booked out 
							for months to my disappointment. I got lucky and found it cheaper, and a better tour, from Viator. After an hour long road trip through olive country, we made it and I was surprised to say the least. I didn't realize that the 
							city of Granada was backed by such high mountains, at the base, the breathtaking Muslim palace complex of the Alhambra. Added to it by Charles V with his unfinished palace and a Catholic church, the site is immense. The only way to truly 
							appreciate it is to see it in person. I thought I had seen it through documentaries and web tours for a landscaping class, but none of that had prepared me for what it was like in person.
							<h4>Tips for the Alhambra</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>Good shoes are a must, there is a lot of walking.</li>
							<li>Bring your own headphones, the tour guides have to use whisperers and the headphones weren't the best.</li>
							<li>Bring a good camera, there are lots of amazing photo ops.</li>
							<li>Plan some time for Granada as well. The city is amazing on its own.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:4">
						<h3>Gibraltar</h3>
						<img src="./images/europe2018/rockofgibraltar_thumb.jpg">
							<p>Since learning of the Pillars of Hercules I have wanted to see them in person. The tour guides at the base are very pushy about purchasing a guided car tour up the rock. It 
							turns out they know what they are pushing. We had booked a self-guided tour that included a ride to the rock from the cruise port, and a cable car ticket up the Rock of Gibraltar. We added a visit to St. Michael's Cave while there. 
							We should have paid the extra for the guided car tour. We ended up exhausted from hiking halfway down the rock to the cave, then back up to take the cable car down due to a lack of time to make it back to the cruise terminal. Added to 
							the walk through town back to the terminal, we should have just paid for the car tour. The rock itself was a beautiful experience and we have some great video and amazing pictures of the Barbary Apes that inhabit it. We even got to witness 
							Carnival's official photographer being used as a perch by one trying to steal his camera gear.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="lesson"><em>Lesson 3 - Don't be cheap, pay for a taxi if you need to. Walking too much can take away from the enjoyment of the vacation.</em></span>
							<h4>Tips for Gibraltar</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>Bring a jacket, it was windy.</li>
							<li>Don't bring anything that isn't attachable to your body, the monkeys are thieves.</li>
							<li>Good shoes are a must, there is a lot of walking.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>

						<h3>Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
						<img src="./images/europe2018/winery_thumb.jpg">
						<p>I need to go back to Lisbon sometime. I was talked into a day trip to a winery and Cabo da Roca, the most western point in Europe. The winery was amazing, and I usually hate wine. I discovered I like port wines and should stay 
						far away from them. I want to go back to Lisbon to see the sites and learn the history in the city, as it had so much of an impact on the Colonial Period.</p>	
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:6">
						<h3>Vigo, Tui, and Valen&ccedil;a</h3>
						<img src="./images/europe2018/tuicathedralcloister_thumb.jpg">
							<p>I fell in love with this region, despite how poor it was. I loved the Galencia region of Spain. Imagine the Pacific Northwest, but Spain. For this stop we did another day trip to Tui and Valen&ccedil;a. Here we visited a town in Spain and 
							another across the valley in Portugal to see the differences in the towns. The cultural differences just across that small border were amazing. The old fort was very fun to see and compare to the forts in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
							The market in the fort had some good deals for cloth goods, so if you do visit the area be sure to leave some room in your bags.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:7">
						<h3>Halifax, Nova Scotia</h3>
						
							<p>I was conned into a whale watching cruise here. Since I had been picking several of our excursions to this point I allowed my sister to make the choice in Halifax. No whales...<br>
							I really didn't get much of a taste for Halifax because our whale cruise took our entire time in this port. I may go back at some point, but only if I do a New England cruise most likely.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:8">
						<h3>New York, New York</h3>
						<img src="./images/europe2018/nycpark_thumb.jpg">
							<p>I have always wanted to go to NYC. Our cruise ending here just made it too good to pass up; however, I almost had to. When looking for hotels, everything on Hotels.com was super expensive, or 
							very far outside the city before it was affordable on my budget. Finally, using Google Maps, we were able to find a quality and affordable hotel only a block from the cruise terminal and the <i>USS Intrepid</i>.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="lesson"><em>Lesson 4 - Don't just use one tool, use multiple sites to find flights, hotels, etc. You never know where you might find a diamond.</em></span>
							<br>
							<br>
							Over 4 days we managed to make it to all but a few sites we wanted, even though we had to rush a couple thanks to bad planning on my part on one item. Day one had us at the <i>USS Intrepid</i> getting in my science nerd points visiting the space shuttle. 
							From there, and over the next three days, we hit Time Square multiple times, 2 bus tours of Manhattan, the World Trade Center site, Rockefeller Center for the Top of the Rock, St Patrick's Cathedral, The MET, The Museum of Modern Art, Central Park, Battery Park, and 
							managed to get in a showing of "Phantom of the Opera." We did miss out on a few of the museums I wanted to go to, and this was partly due to my confusion on the subway system in NYC and the fact part of it was down for construction while we were there.<br>
							I also didn't realize it was Memorial Day Weekend and Fleet Week when I planned this trip the year before. This caused everything to be a bit more crowded, was why the hotels were so much more expensive, and why part of the subway system was down.
							<br>
							<br>
							<span class="lesson"><em>Lesson 5 - Remember holidays when planning trips!</em></span>
							<h4>Tips for New York</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>Research and understand the subway. Apps like Movit are invaluable.</li>
							<li>Don't rely on the hop-on-hop-off tours to get around, it will take too much time.</li>
							<li>We had issues trying to use Uber and Lyft on Manhattan. We wonder if it was a lack of using it before. Be aware.</li>
							</ul>
							</p> 
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:9">
						<h3>Am I Going Back?</h3>
							<p>
							I plan to return to most of these locations in some form. Barcelona is the departure point for many Mediterranean cruise itineraries and I plan to take a few of those. The British Isle fascinate me, and I want to return to explore the history more.
