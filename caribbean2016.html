						<h2>Almost Made it to South America</h2>
							<p class="tripIntro">This was my second trip to the Caribbean, the furthest south I had ever been, and the longest trip I had been on to this point. It taught me a few lessons about over-packing, and dealing with
							 illness on a trip.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="hide">
						*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:2">
						<h3>St Thomas, US Virgin Islands</h3>
							<p>
							This port we chose to snorkel around a national marine area in the hopes of seeing sea turtles. We weren&apos;t disappointed. While the reefs weren&apos;t extensive, we did get to see several sea turtles, 
							sting rays, and other marine life. I&apos;d like to go back and visit the Virgin Islands more. There are ferries that travel between the various islands so you aren&apos;t limited to just the one.
							<br>
							My pictures of this experience are actually a GoPro video. When I can find my video files I plan to load them to YouTube and link them here.
							</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:3">
						<h3>Grenada</h3>
							<img src="./images/caribbean2016/grenada_thumb.jpg" alt="Picture of Grenada from the harbor">
							<p>
							I played the cruise tourist in Grenada. We booked a tubing trip down a &quot;river.&quot; Lesson learned. The &quot;river&quot; had been improved with plastic sheeting to make it deep enough for the tubes to pass down in places. 
							There were some areas where it was deep and slow, and these were great, but the other sections required the guides to push us through the shallow sections. Otherwise, the island is beautiful and I would consider 
							going back to explore it further.
							</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:4">
						<h3>Barbados</h3>
							<p>
							Barbados is famous for its spices and I was looking forward to this. I couldn&apos;t convince my cruise partner to go on the tour of the spice plantation. Instead, we did some shopping and spent some time on the beach. 
							I want to go back to the island someday and explore further. We had a scuba trip booked here, but had to cancel due to illness. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t have pictures of this island.
							</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:5">
						<h3>Trinidad and Tobago</h3>
							<img src="./images/caribbean2016/fortkinggeorge_thumb.jpg" alt="A building at Fort King George on Tobago">
							<p>
							We did a tour of the Colonial Era forts on Trinidad for this stop. The history was amazing, the scenery almost more so. We did have some harrowing experiences flying along narrow mountain roads barely wide enough for 1 car in the US,
							and holding 2 cars with others parked along side. If you are a golfer, the island has some beautiful looking courses and resorts available on the Caribbean side.</p>
							<h4>Tips for Trinidad and Tobago</h4>
								<ul>
								<li>Don&apos;t drive yourself, it&apos;s too crazy.</li>
								<li>Hire a driver, close your eyes, hold on, and pray!</li>
								</ul>
							
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:6">
						<h3>Aruba</h3>
							<img src="./images/caribbean2016/aruba_thumb.jpg" alt="Natural Park in Aruba">
							<p>My traveling partner had gotten sick between Trinidad and Aruba. We had planned a scuba diving excursion for this stop. Instead, I went out solo onto the island. 
							I booked a car tour of the island, probably not my smartest idea, and set out to see the sites. My guide took me around to some of the natural features of Aruba, pointing out the 
							features that showed the volcanic origins of the island. The disparity between the poorer areas and the wealthy was telling. With grand resorts and mansions filling one end of the island, and the other 
							home to the working population of the island.</p>
							<h4>Tips for Aruba</h4>
								<ul>
								<li>The water and beaches are amazing! Plan to enjoy them.</li>
								<li>Sunscreen! Playing in water you&apos;ll need to reapply frequently.</li>
								<li>Based on what my guide said, the island is very desert-like in climate. Plan for it.</li>
								</ul>
							
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:7">
						<h3>Grand Cayman</h3>
							<p>
							We booked another snorkeling trip here and this was the best of the trip. The reef we swam over was in a protected area, and teaming with fish. To get there we also go to do one of the stupider things I&apos;ve 
							ever done, drive a jet ski on the ocean without ever having driven one before. I almost crashed several times when I took waves at high speed. For the first time on a jet ski, it probably shouldn&apos;t have been in such an active marine environment.
							<br>
							My pictures of this experience are actually a GoPro video. When I can find my video files I plan to load them to YouTube and link them here.
							</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:8">
						<h3>Houston, Texas</h3>
							<p>
							Houston was a visit to family to cap out the cruise. I couldn&apos;t pass up a trip to the Johnson Space Center though. Unfortunately, I decided to use my new GoPro to take the pictures and many did not turn out. 
							Some day I&apos;ll go back and visit again.</p>
							<h4>Tips for Houston and the Space Center</h4>
								<ul>
								<li>Plan the majority of a day, there is a lot to see.</li>
								<li>Take advantage of the tours, you&apos;ll see more than if you just go to the visitor center.</li>
								<li>Get there early, it gets crowded fast.</li>
								</ul>
							
					</div>
					
					<div class="detailsBox" style="order:9">
						<h3>Am I Going Back?</h3>
							<p class="tripIntro">For most of these places I would go back if I had the opportunity. Barbados and Aruba if they were a stop on another cruise, others I would consider as destinations themselves. Trinidad would be fun if I ever learn to golf.</p>
